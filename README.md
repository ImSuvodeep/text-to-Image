# text-to-Image
 Implementation of an image generation process using a combination of the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model and a VQ-VAE-2 based generator from the "taming-transformers" repository. The generated images are optimized based on input prompts, including both positive and negative textual cues.


 Here's a breakdown of the main components and steps in the code:

Setup and Installation:

Clones two GitHub repositories: "CLIP-Architecture" and "taming-transformers."
Installs necessary libraries using pip.
Import Libraries:

Imports various Python libraries, including PyTorch, CLIP, and others for image processing.
CLIP Model Initialization:

Loads a pre-trained CLIP model (ViT-B/32) and sets it to evaluation mode.
Prints information about the available CLIP models.
Taming Transformer Instantiation:

Downloads the necessary checkpoints and configurations for a VQ-VAE-2 model from the "taming-transformers" repository.
Defines functions for loading the configuration and model for the VQ-VAE-2.
Parameters and Optimization Setup:

Defines various parameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and image shape.
Initializes CLIP-related parameters and optimizer.
Defines functions for encoding text using CLIP.
Image Generation and Augmentation:

Defines functions for generating images from the VQ-VAE-2 model and creating image crops with random transformations.
Optimization and Training:

Defines functions for optimizing the generated images based on given prompts.
Iterates through training for a specified number of iterations, optimizing the images based on the prompts.
Training Configuration:

Specifies prompts for image generation, including positive and negative cues.
Sets weights and other parameters for optimization.
Training Execution:

Calls the training function with the specified prompts and parameters.
Note: It seems there might be an inconsistency in the code related to the variable extras_enc, which is defined inside the createEncoding function but referenced outside. You may want to review this part based on the specific requirements of your implementation.
