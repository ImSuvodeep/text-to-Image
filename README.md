# text-to-Image
 Implementation of an image generation process using a combination of the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model and a VQ-VAE-2 based generator from the "taming-transformers" repository. The generated images are optimized based on input prompts, including both positive and negative textual cues.
